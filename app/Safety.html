This science searches for the creation of new ‘programmable’ organisms that behave like small computers. However, this kind of biological engineering requires levels of precaution, therefore the safety and ethical aspects of synthetic biology must be guaranteed. For this reason, it is of vital importance to strictly follow the safety regulations in a project that involve microorganisms and use harmful biological material. In addition, we are a team that perform his experimental part in the university, having this set of regulations ensures the well-being of the team, teachers, students and bar/cleaning staff.

                <p class="orange book">In our project, a whole set of genetically modified organisms have been used and so, handling safety should be considered. We have worked with E. coli, which is a RISK GROUP II agent. This group includes pathogens that can cause diseases to humans or animals. However, under normal circumstances it doesn’t produce serious risks to laboratory workers, community, natural resources or the environment. Laboratory exposures rarely lead to infections that cause serious illness. Different strains were used according to their characteristics and the culture purpose. Escherichia coli DH5 alpha/BL21-DE3 and Pichia pastoris were used in the cloning process. In both cases, pET / pPIC / pGAp plasmids were used in the assembly process which are not harmful to humans or other living organisms. Ethidium bromide is an intercalating agent commonly used as a nucleic acid clarifier in molecular biology laboratories for processes such as agarose gel electrophoresis. This can cause mutations in DNA, so the use of gloves and working with basic guidelines should be considered.

Then, safety is a completely multidisciplinary area. Follow safety protocols enable academic researchers, decision makers companies and government agencies to standardise techniques and apply them properly. But safety also includes the proper usage of genetic data obtained from the experiments. Our project’s purpose, apart from the development of the sensor, aims to create a big database. There, genes involved in celiac disease and new HLA related genes would be stored and use for research. This service requires the informed consent to users, as their genetic information will be used for scientific purposes.
