			<h1> Results </h1>

			<p> This page should contain: </p>
			<ul> 
				<li> Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.</li>
				<li> Future plans for the project. </li>
				<li> Considerations for replicating the experiments. </li>
			</ul>

			<p> Describe what your results mean </p>
			<ul> 
				<li> Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. </li>
				<li> Show data, but remember all measurement and characterization data must be on part pages in the Registry. </li>
				<li> Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during the project. </li>
			</ul>

			<p> You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you had over the summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during the summer. 
			<ul> 
				<li> A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during the project. </li>
				<li> A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort. </li>
