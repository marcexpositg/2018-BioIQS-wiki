Although the DQ2-specific residue, Lys-&beta;71, plays a key role in stabilizing this residue, the x-ray structure reveals a surprisingly complex network of noncovalent interactions. If Gln were present at this position instead of Glu (i.e., the non-deamidated native gliadin peptide), this intricate hydrogen-bonding network would be disrupted. Also, the Gln carbonyl oxygen is a less attractive hydrogen-bond acceptor than the negatively charged Glu carboxylate oxygen.</p>
