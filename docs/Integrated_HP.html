                                                <p class="book orange">We observed that, in blood tests, only the presence or absence of certain HLA alleles is examined, namely HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8 and HLA-DQ7. This is because 99.5% of celiac patients carry one of these alleles, and so, if the patient doesn‚Äôt carry any of these, celiac disease is unlikely to appear, as the above predisposition alleles are an almost essential prerequisite for the development of celiac disease. Due to legal reasons, we are not allowed to show the real diagnosis, but the following picture illustrates how the results are presented to verify if the patient has a predisposition to develop celiac disease or not.</p>

For this reason, we looked into the most well-known sensor, the NIMA sensor. The NIMA integrates food processing, gluten detection, result interpretation and data transmission, but, from the point of view of celiac people, there are a lot of characteristics missing in order for it to be the perfect one. So, in order to find its main flaws, we have to know how the detection and the food processing works (link a la part d‚Äôapplication design). This example shows us how the sensor is not completely reliable. </p>

Another important improvement for the stakeholders would be the price reduction of our sensor compared to NIMA‚Äôs. The NIMA device itself costs $279, and each one-time use capsule is about $5.</p>

At the beginning we had three main ideas, all of these based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We decided to use this technique due to the fact that the vibrant colours produced by their interaction with visible light are strongly dictated by the shape or size of the nanoparticles. The usage of gold nanoparticles also greatly reduces price of the final product compared to antibody-based sensors.</p>

                                    <p class="orange">Everything seems to indicate that personalized medicine will be key in the near future. Up until now, drugs and other pharmacological products have mostly been used without considering the particularities of each patient. Being able to adapt treatments and interventions to the characteristics of each individual will obviously bring many advantages.</p>
                                    <p class="orange">In the case of personalized sensors, they can allow people to have immediate information about the variations that occur in their bodies, which can be very useful and convenient for both them and doctors.</p>
                                    <p class="orange">On the other hand, we need to be careful and it is of utmost importance to explain in detail how these sensors should be used. They should be treated as devices that allow patients to become more autonomous and more aware of their condition so they can make decisions about it. However, unwanted effects may also arise, for example, individuals who carry these sensors could be continuously obsessed with the data offered by the device. Rational and measured control of the body and health is positive, excessive concern, on the other hand, becomes unfavorable. Therefore, this new technology should be accompanied by continued support to the users. </p>

You just have to think about the cell phone. However, with these sensors we are talking about a technique that will constantly give us information about the biological parameters of our body; all those aspects that can have an effect in our health. Will we make a good use of them? We don‚Äôt know yet. However, as an example, there are always people who make very good use of their mobile phones and others who don‚Äôt.</p>
                                    <p class="orange">You will also have to be careful with the handling of the data offered by these sensors. For instance, confidentiality and privacy must always be safeguarded so data is not used against us. When looking for a job, should human resources ask for these sensors to know more about us? Definitely not.</p>

                                        Our project fits in the subject of personalized medicine because it requires the extraction and use of the genetic material of the patient, to reproduce a specific protein that catalyzes the detection process. What is your opinion on using the genetic material from a patient to manufacture its own sensor?<i class="fa fa-angle-down rotate-icon fa-2x"></i>

The principle of autonomy: the user should be very well informed about the technique, its objectives, its effects, etc. Only if you have good information you can decide freely. The principles of charity and non-malice: to assess the benefits and risks, considering the preferences of the users themselves. And finally, respect the principle of justice: not to discriminate anybody for reasons regarding the social class, ethnicity, sex, religion, etc. This last principle is important in the case of sensors. Who will benefit from this technique? Will you be able to acquire the device via Social Security or only those with a certain income will benefit from it?</p>

                                        To sum it all up, we would like to ask you a final question about the main theme of the competition (iGEM) where we are presenting the project proposal. Genetic engineering, and more specifically, synthetic biology and the rational modification of genetic material, leads all the projects involved in order to solve problems that are present in today‚Äôs society. What is your opinion about the use of these tools? Do you think they are the future?<i class="fa fa-angle-down rotate-icon fa-2x"></i>

These are issues that will guide the direction of our society in the future, so all citizens should be well informed, participate in the debates and be able to contribute to the final decisions. It is not what predominates, of course, but perhaps it is time to democratize science, especially the one funded with public money.</p>
