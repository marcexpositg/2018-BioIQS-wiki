1. When asked for Team name, didn't change the teamName value correctly in the config.js file:
    Before:

    // Teaminfo. Duh.
    const teaminfo = {
        year: 2018,
        teamName: 'Virginia'
    };

    Now:

    // Teaminfo. Duh.
    const teaminfo = {
        year: 2018,
        teamName: 'BioIQS-Barcelona'
    };

    Without this change ANYTHING worked and the wiki didn't upload fine.

2. Added jpeg, pdf and txt to config.js as image files: (we could also have renamed .jpeg images as .jpg) or include the pdf/txt files manually.
    Before:
        const imagetypes = '{png,jpg,gif,svg}';
    After:
        const imagetypes = '{png,jpg,gif,svg,jpeg,pdf,txt}';

    Added svg, woff2 and eof to font types, because fonts from font awesome were on the app but not on the build folder.
    Before:
        const fonttypes = '{ttf,otf,woff}';
    After:
        const fonttypes = '{ttf,otf,woff,svg,woff2,eot}';

    Both things worked nicely!
    
3. Our web designer used the tag <header> to style some "jumbotron-like" parts of the page. This caused a conflict
when using the tags <header></header> to insert the Navigation Bar template. For this reason, I changed the tags in
all pages .html files from header to <navigationbar> (which is never used, avoiding conflicts). Of course, I also had
to change the script in the beggining of the page which inserts the .html code of the templates in the page (by the way,
excellent idea on how to manage templates locally - before, I used iframes which is NOT practical AT ALL).
You could think on using that. I know it is only a problem if you use the header class, but I think that could be useful
for teams which have already started creating their wiki before using the igem-wikibrick tool.

    Before:
   
    <script>
        $(function () {
            $('header').load('/templates/header.html');
            $('footer').load('/templates/footer.html');
        });
    </script>

        [[etc...]]

    <body id="page-top">
    <div id="igem-navbar-placeholder">
        <p>Placeholder for iGEM Navbar</p>
    </div>
    <header></header>


    After (note the 3rd and the last line, 'navigationbar' is used intead of 'header'):

    <script>
        $(function () {
            $('navigationbar').load('/templates/header.html');
            $('footer').load('/templates/footer.html');
        });
    </script>

        [[etc...]]

    <body id="page-top">
    <div id="igem-navbar-placeholder">
        <p>Placeholder for iGEM Navbar</p>
    </div>
    <navigationbar></navigationbar>
